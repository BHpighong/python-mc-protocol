# python-mc-protocol
A Python-based command generator for Mitsubishi PLC using MC Protocol (ASCII mode), supporting batch &amp; random write for M/D devices

# üß† Mitsubishi PLC Command Generator (Python + MC Protocol)

This project provides a Python-based command generator for **Mitsubishi PLC communication via MC Protocol (ASCII mode)**.

It is designed specifically for **Python developers working with PLCs**, as well as **automation engineers looking to script control sequences in Python**.

## üîß Features

- ‚úÖ Generate MC Protocol-compliant command frames (ASCII 3C frame)
- ‚úÖ Supports **Batch Write** and **Random Write** for both Bit (M/Y) and Word (D/W) devices
- ‚úÖ Accepts **decimal inputs** and auto-converts to ASCII-encoded hex
- ‚úÖ Compatible with **serial or TCP communication**
- ‚úÖ Utility functions for **32-bit word splitting** (D10/D11, D20/D21, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Easy to integrate into **PC-based automation / servo control systems**

## üöÄ Quick Example

```python
from mc_protocol_rw import McProtocolRW
from utils import dec_to_ascii_hex_list, dec32_to_Dword_ascii

mc = McProtocolRW()

# Batch write to M0 ~ M3
cmd1 = mc.commant_batch('M0', [1, 0, 1, 1])

# Random write to D100 = 10, D101 = 20
cmd2 = mc.commant_random(['D100', 'D101'], dec_to_ascii_hex_list([10, 20]))

# Write 32-bit value (30000000) into D10 (high), D11 (low)
cmd3 = mc.commant_random(['D10', 'D11'], dec32_to_Dword_ascii([30000000]))
